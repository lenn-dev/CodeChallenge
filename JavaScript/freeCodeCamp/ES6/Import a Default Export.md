# Import a Default Export
In the last challenge, you learned about export default and its uses. To import a default export, you need to use a different import syntax. 
In the following example, `add` is the default export of the `math_functions.js` file. Here is how to import it:
```javascript
import add from "./math_functions.js";
```
The syntax differs in one key place. The imported value, `add`, is `not` surrounded by curly braces (`{}`). 
add here is simply a variable name for whatever the default export of the `math_functions.js` file is. 
You can use any name here when importing a default.

In the following code, import the default export from the `math_functions.js` file, found in the same directory as this file. 
Give the import the name `subtract`.

## Before
```javascript
  
// Only change code above this line

subtract(7,4);
```

## Answers
```javascript
import subtract from "./math_functions.js";
